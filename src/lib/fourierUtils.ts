/**
 * # Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)
 *
 * The DFT transforms a finite sequence of equally-spaced samples of a function
 * into a same-length sequence of equally-spaced samples of the discrete-time
 * Fourier transform (DTFT), which is a complex-valued function of frequency.
 *
 * ## Formula
 *
 * For a sequence of N complex numbers x₀, x₁, ..., x_{N-1}, the DFT is
 * transformed into a sequence of N complex numbers X₀, X₁, ..., X_{N-1} by:
 *
 *   X_k = Σ_{n=0}^{N-1} x_n * e^(-i * 2π * k * n / N)
 *
 * Where:
 * - N     = number of samples (e.g., number of historical sensor readings)
 * - n     = current sample index (from 0 to N-1)
 * - x_n   = value of the signal at time n (e.g., a sensor reading like CO2 level)
 * - k     = current frequency index (from 0 to N-1), where k represents the k-th "frequency bin"
 * - X_k   = the k-th DFT coefficient (a complex number representing amplitude and phase of a frequency component)
 * - Σ     = summation from n=0 to N-1
 * - e     = Euler's number (base of the natural logarithm)
 * - i     = imaginary unit (i² = -1)
 * - π     = Pi
 *
 * ## Interpretation for Sensor Data
 *
 * - Input (x_n): A series of sensor readings (e.g., temperature values taken every minute for an hour).
 * - Output (X_k): Each X_k represents the strength (amplitude) and starting point (phase)
 *                 of a specific frequency component present in the input data.
 *                 - The frequency corresponding to X_k is (k * sampling_rate) / N.
 *                 - A large magnitude for |X_k| indicates a strong presence of that frequency.
 *
 * ## Practical Considerations
 * - The output X_k is complex. Usually, we are interested in the magnitude |X_k| (amplitude spectrum)
 *   and sometimes the phase arg(X_k) (phase spectrum).
 * - The magnitude spectrum is often plotted against frequency to see dominant frequencies.
 * - For real-valued input (like sensor data), the DFT output is conjugate symmetric: X_k = conj(X_{N-k}).
 *   This means only the first N/2 + 1 components are typically unique and analyzed.
 * - Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) is an algorithm to compute the DFT efficiently, especially when N is a power of 2.
 *
 * ## Example Placeholder for Implementation
 *
 * The function below is a placeholder and does not implement the DFT.
 * A real implementation would involve complex number arithmetic and iteration.

  // 2. Looping for k from 0 to N-1 (or N/2 for real inputs due to symmetry).
  // 3. Inside that loop, looping for n from 0 to N-1 to calculate the sum:

  // 4. Storing the real and imaginary parts of X_k.
  // 5. Calculating magnitude (|X_k| = sqrt(real(X_k)² + imag(X_k)²))
  // 6. Calculating phase (arg(X_k) = atan2(imag(X_k), real(X_k)))
  //
  // Libraries like 'fft.js' or implementing the Cooley-Tukey FFT algorithm are common.
